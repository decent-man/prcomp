A website which compares product prices,stat,store services,etc

Have you ever come across the problem of finding the best possible offer on a product?
Isn't it hard to surf through plethora of online shopping websites just to find the best balance between price and services offered(warranty,returns,shipping,etc) while also trying to dodge despicable seller practices(**huge discounts = no after-sales services**..sound familiar?)

This project aims to solve this exact problem by enhancing on the problem of a standard shopping comparsison website by not only offering listings by price but also be able to see the services provided by the particular seller.
